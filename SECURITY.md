## Reporting a Vulnerability
# Security Policy for ByteCrypt

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerabilities within this project, please report them as soon as possible. We appreciate your help in improving the security of this project.

## Security Practices

### Cryptographic Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Keys**: Always use recommended key sizes when generating keys (2048 bits for RSA keys is recommended).
2. **Initialization Vectors (IV)**: Ensure that the initialization vector used in encryption modes is generated securely and is unique for each encryption operation.
3. **Do Not Reuse Keys**: Avoid reusing cryptographic keys across different encryption sessions. Each session should use a newly generated key where applicable.
4. **Secret Management**: Secrets (keys, IVs) should be stored securely. Avoid hardcoding secrets in your code. Use secure storage solutions when relevant.

### Algorithms and Modes

- This library supports various symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms and modes. Be sure to select appropriate encryption modes for your use case (e.g., GCM for authenticated encryption).
- Avoid using outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5 hashing) wherever possible. Prefer stronger hashing functions like SHA-256 or bcrypt for password hashing.

### Exception Handling

Make use of the built-in error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions gracefully during cryptographic operations. Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.

### Dependencies

Ensure that the project's dependencies (like Crypto++) are regularly updated to their latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

## Security Audit

This project will undergo regular security audits. Contributions that introduce new functionality must also include a review of potential security implications.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. Security clauses from the license apply to any contributions or usage of the project.
